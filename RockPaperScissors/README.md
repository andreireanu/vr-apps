## Installing

You can simply download the whole repository or run the following commands to clone just this project:

```
git clone --depth 1 --quiet --no-checkout "https://github.com/andreireanu/vr-apps" Unity
cd Unity
git checkout master -- RockPaperScissors/
```

## Running the application

Double-click on the ```RockPaperScissors.exe``` file to start the application. You'll see Pepe waiting for you to start a new duel. Once you give him the ```OK``` he will execute a ```rock```, a ```paper``` or a ```scissors``` gesture on the count of three. He will then declare if there's a winner, if there's a tie or if you haven't executed one of the three gestures that define this game and after a short break he will be prepared for another duel.
